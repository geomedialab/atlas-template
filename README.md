# Template for deploying Atlascine

[Atlascine](https://atlascine.org) is a story mapping research tool developed by the [Geomedia Lab at Concordia University](https://geomedialab.org/) in collaboration with the [GCRC at Carleton University](https://gcrc.carleton.ca/). Development has been funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and by the [CANARIE Research Software Program](https://www.canarie.ca/software/). You can read more on Atlascine's history and previous versions of the tool on the [project website](https://atlascine.org).

Atlascine uses the open source web atlas framework [Nunaliit](http://nunaliit.org/). Like other adaptations of Nunaliit, Atlascine can be installed and deployed from your own server. This public repository contains everything you need to deploy Atlascine yourself along with [extensive documentation on how to do it](https://github.com/geomedialab/atlas-template/wiki/How-to-deploy-Atlascine).

[The wiki](https://github.com/geomedialab/atlas-template/wiki/) also contains additional guidance for [how to use](https://github.com/geomedialab/atlascine-template/wiki/How-to-use-Atlascine) and [how to manage](https://github.com/geomedialab/atlascine-template/wiki/Managing-an-atlas) an Atlascine atlas, as well as [developer documentation](https://github.com/geomedialab/atlascine-template/wiki/Developer-documentation).
